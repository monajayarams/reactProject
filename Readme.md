# Instructions

Fork this project, create a React application that meets the following requirements, then email us a link to your completed codesandbox project.

## 1. The application has multiple "views" or "pages" that exist at independent URLs. Feel free to use a routing lib like React Router to accomplish this.

## 2. On the first view, hit a public api that returns an array of items. Map over the response and create a summary display for each item. Some examples might be:

- Github api to get a list of repos
- Github api to return Pull Requests for a particular project
- There is a large list of other APIS that you could choose from here - https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis (choose one you can hit from the browser)

## 3. The second view should be a details page where you can view further details about one of the summary items.

- There should be a way back to the summary

## 4. Create a third page with a form with that has a checkbox, a radio selection, an input, and a select. The names or values is not important, so feel free to be creative.

- All fields are required, and the user should get feedback when trying to submit the form when it is in an invalid state.
- If all fields pass validation, console.log the form values and then reset the form back to its initial state.

## Bonus points (not required) for using TypeScript and/or Styled Components
